    "description": "# PyReParse\nPyReParse is a library the helps to ease the development processes of parsing\ncomplex reports, which have enough structure for effective regular expression \nprocessing.\n\nPyReParse is a library that helps one create parsing engines for formed text reports. I had a such a need when I was tasked to parse a Financial Institution\u0027s archived transaction reports where the databases that held this data no-longer existed. So the data in the report forms was the only data available to re-create the original database. Thus, regular-expressions were used to find and capture certain field values, and validation calculations were needed to ensure that the data going into the database was complete and accurate.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n\n## Benefits...\n\n- The benefits of using PyReParse include...\n- The use of a standard data structure for holding regular expressions. \nAssociated to the regexp are additional flags and fields that help to reduce the\nnumber of times a given regexp is executed.\n- Regexp processing can be expensive. The goal is to run regexp matches only when they \nare needed. So if you know that the pattern for regexp A always occurs before\nregexp B, you can use the data structure to specify that regexp B should not\nbe used until after regexp A triggers.\n- All regular expressions and their associated properties are in one data structure.\n- Additional benefits include the ability to crosscheck a non-matching line which\na simpler regexp that can ... name evaluates to True if the pattern has been matched, and False if the pattern as not been matched since the last \"NEW_SECTION\", A \"New Section\" occurs when a pattern that has the flag **PyReParse.FLAG_NEW_SECTION** matches the current line, and it triggers the reset of section counters.\n\n## Coding Callbacks...\nYou may also code callbacks that are executed when a pattern matches. The callback function is called when a pattern matches, and after the fields have been captured. The callback function is passed the PyReParse instance, and the name of the pattern that matched. The callback function can then use the PyReParse instance to access any currently captured fields, and perform any processing logic field value updates.\n\n\u003cbr\u003e\n## License...\n\nApache 2.0\n",
